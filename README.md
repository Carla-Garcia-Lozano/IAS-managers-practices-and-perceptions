# Management-related questions

Preliminary results of the survey about management and perceptions launched on February 2022 to understand local managers on IAS practices and perceptions in Europe.

The survey was composed of 29 questions, some related to the management of invasive alien species and others context-related questions about the area managed and the respondent's profile. The results shown here are based on 1925 responses across 41 European countries. If you would like to respond to the survey, please [click here](https://www.1ka.si/a/348996).

Thank you very much for your contribution.
